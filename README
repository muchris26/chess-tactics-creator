run command: python tactics_creator.py

Command Line Python Script that takes in a PGN file of your chess games and 
creates a PGN and FEN of your mistakes to study with your preferred program.
PGN and FEN are placed in the results folder.  Results are dated and will
overwrite if you run twice in a day!  Remember to rename your results.  

I would recommend inputting the PGN results into YATT.  Very nice format and 
uses spaced repetition to practice.

** Configuration settings **

There is a CONFIG file in the main directory used to provide details to the 
program.
1. Player Name (Only assesses your mistakes, not your opponents)
2. Engine Name (I suggest placing in main directory for ease)
3. PGN File Name - Default is "game.pgn"
